# Introduction

As members of Columbia community, we benefit from our diversified student body. We value and advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion. However, in recent months, the deaths of George Floyde and numerous black individuals have reached the mainstream media and we see the need to learn more about social prejudice and discrimination, and to facilitate collective effort to identify actionable solutions. Black community is not the only victim: it is only a tip of the ice-burg. Discrimination and prejudice can be a real and distressing problem that affects everyone. In this project, we look into hate crimes, the most extreme form of prejudice.

A hate crime is a "criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity." It is identified as one of .  Hate crimes have server impact on our society in that damage is not limited to the immediate target of the crime, but to the entire group the victim represents.

What populations, besides African Americans are susceptible to biases? How much progress, if any, we've made in fighting against bias and discrimination.  In what region do hate crimes occur most frequently? We resort to the New York Hate Crime data set to find answers. 

In order to have better understanding on hate crimes in New York State, we are looking for answers to these three questions:

a)  What's the most frequent kind of hate crimes (i.e. against religion or race) in the State of New York and in its counties from 2010 to 2018? 

b) Which county in New York State has a relative large number of hate crimes? For each county, what's the proportions of different kinds of hate crimes? If it's different, can it suggest that county influences the distribution of hate crimes?
  
c)  What is the trend of hate crimes in numbers and types, in New York State from 2010 to 2018? We will also dive in to look at the trend in each county. 

The answers of these questions can give us very basic understanding of hate crimes in New York State, which can also serve as a good start for people who want to know more about hate crimes in New York State. The records of law enforcement only contain hate crimes investigated, and it's highly possible the real data is way beyond this. Especially given the fact that systemic racism is still common in this country.
