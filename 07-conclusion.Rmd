# Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully analyzed the New York state hate crime data set. We now have a clear picture of how frequently each type of hate crimes occur in New York state, how hate crimes are distributed among each county and the change of total incidents across the years between 2010 and 2018. 

Unfortunately, our data set does not include data on hate groups who committed these crimes. It will be interesting to see the correlation between hate groups and hate crimes. For example, what type of hate crimes do particular hate groups commit most often? Do areas of high hate group activity also have a high number of hate crimes? Are there any correlation between incidents of hate speech and hate crimes? 

It will also be interesting to analyze hate crimes across the entire United State. However, each state uses a different system of reporting hate crimes, and even different criteria on defining hate crimes. For example, some states are more dedicated in identifying hate crimes whereas other state do not put in as much effort, due to the natural that it is hard to cite tangible evidence that a crime is due to "hate". 

We also noticed that certain group of hate crime victims are more hesitant to report hate crimes due to a chronic distrust between the community and the police. For example, survey evidences shows that LGBTQ group often choose not to report hate crimes, and their cases would not be prosecuted as hate crimes. Although we believe the total number of hate crimes is underreported, we are not certain whether particulars type of hate crime is underreported to a greater extent than averge. It will be interesting look into data set of people's received hate crimes, rather than only hate crimes being prosecuted.
