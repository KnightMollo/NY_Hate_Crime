["index.html", "Hate Crimes in the State of New York Chapter 1 Introduction", " Hate Crimes in the State of New York Haichao Yi, Heng Kan, Danyang Han, Zhuoyan Ma 2020-12-17 Chapter 1 Introduction All members of the Columbia community benefit from our diverse student body. We value and advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion. However, in recent months, the shocking deaths of George Floyd and numerous other black individuals have prompted us as well as the nation to learn more about racism and discrimination of all kinds, and to facilitate a collective effort to identify actionable solutions. The black community is not the only victim: it is only the tip of the iceberg. Discrimination and prejudice are real, serious problems that touch the lives of everyone in society, and particularly affect marginalized communities. In this project, we look into hate crimes, the most extreme form of prejudice. A hate crime is defined as any “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity.” Hate crimes exert a grave impact on our society, because the damage they do not only targets the immediate victim of the crime, but is inflicted upon the entire group the victim represents. The tragic events of this summer have cast light on the odiousness and pervasiveness of systemic racism against black people in America. Moreover, the problem seems virtually insurmountable, as bias is often embedded into the fabric of culture and institutions, and many Americans with biases may not be aware of their own prejudice. We sought to peer deeper into the scope and dimensions of racially motivated hate crimes in the United States. What populations besides African Americans are susceptible to bias? How much progress have we made in fighting against bias and discrimination? Indeed, have we made any progress at all in combating hate? In what region do hate crimes occur most frequently? We turned to the New York Hate Crime data set to find answers to these difficult questions. Our aim is to acquire a better understanding of hate crimes in New York State. To accomplish this, we developed the following three questions to serve as touchstones: What kind of hate crime (i.e. a crime motivated by the religion or racial identity of the victim) occurred most frequently in the State of New York from 2010 to 2018? For different kind of hate crimes, does the distribution of total number of incidents in counties vary a lot or not? Which type of hate crimes might occur more frequently and which area might have more incidents than others? How have the numbers and types of hate crimes in New York State changed in from 2010 to 2018? What is the overall trend? We will also address these questions at the county level. The answers to these questions can give us a very basic understanding of hate crimes in New York State. This basic understanding can also serve as a solid foundation for further research on hate crimes in New York State for those who are interested in doing so. Law enforcement agencies’ records only contain hate crimes that are investigated, and it is entirely possible, if not likely, that the real data—that is, the true number of hate crimes committed—vastly exceeds the number of cases investigated by law enforcement. The fact that systemic racism is still common in this country suggests that this could be the case. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Provider 2.2 Problems with data source", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Provider The data set is named as “Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type: Beginning 2010” and it is provided by New York Division of Criminal Justice Services. The Office of Justice Research and Performance is responsible for collecting data. Link to dataset: Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type: Beginning 2010 The definition of hate crime is as followed: Under New York State’s Hate Crime Law (Penal Law Article 485), a person commits a hate crime when one of a specified set of offenses is committed targeting a victim because of a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation, or when such an act is committed as a result of that type of perception or belief. These types of crimes can target an individual, a group of individuals, or public or private property. The dataset has 44 columns and 548 rows. The variable County and Crime Type are strings and all others are integers. Most of columns are names of hate crimes, including Anti.Male, Anti.Female and so on. The problem with this dataset is that many columns are purely names of hate crimes within the same category. For example, Anti.White, Anti.Black, Anti.American Indian/Alaskan Native, Anti.Asian and so on are all hate crimes against specific race. And there are many hate crimes against different religions. When handling this dataset, we will need to do some summary about kinds of hate crimes to have better understanding of this dataset. 2.2 Problems with data source After doing research on hate crimes laws and how hate crimes are prosecuted, we believe our data set could underestimate the amount of actual hate crimes in NY. In order to prosecute, attorneys must prove the defendant’s intent was based on bias, which is notoriously difficult to prove. This added layer of complexity to otherwise straightforward cases of assaults or stealing shun attorneys from doing so, thus resulting in an overall under-reporting of hate crimes. What’s more, the data is based on law enforcement’s records, which means it’s hard to involve all possible prejudice-motivated illegal activities. The statistics doesn’t guarantee all hate crimes are documented. "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We saved the original data as a csv file called ‘Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type_Beginning_2010.csv’. To get the tidy data, we first dropped the last three columns namely Total.Incidents, Total.Victims, Total.Offenders, as we can still calculate them using the remaining data. Then we regarded columns County, Year and Crime.Type as ID columns, which means we don’t make changes on them. We used the pivot_longer method to gather the rest of columns to create two columns Subtype and Count. Here Subtype means each small class of hate crimes such as Anti.Male, Anti.Female etc. Count is the corresponding number of cases for each small class. After that, we created a new column Type, containing six general classes that are Anti.Gender, Anti.Age, Anti.Race, Anti.Religion, Anti.Sexual.Minority and Anti.Disability. For each Subtype, it has a corresponding type. For example, the Subtype Anti.Female is related with the type Anti.Gender and the Subtype Anti.White is related with the type Anti.Race’. We use the for-loop to fill in the Type column for all rows. dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010.csv&quot;) dataset &lt;- subset(dataset, select=-c(42,43,44)) names(dataset)[1] &lt;- &quot;County&quot; data&lt;- dataset %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = !(colnames(dataset)[1] | colnames(dataset)[2] | colnames(dataset)[3]), names_to = &quot;Subtype&quot;, values_to = &quot;Count&quot;) anti_gender = colnames(dataset)[4:7] anti_age = colnames(dataset)[8] anti_race = colnames(dataset)[9:15] anti_religion = colnames(dataset)[16:34] anti_sexual_minority = colnames(dataset)[35:39] anti_disability = colnames(dataset)[40:41] vec = c(rep(0,nrow(data))) data &lt;- cbind(data, Type = vec) for( i in 1:nrow(data)){ if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_gender){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Gender&quot; } if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_age){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Age&quot; } if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_race){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Race&quot; } if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_religion){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Religion&quot; } if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_sexual_minority){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Sexual.Minority&quot; } if(data$`Subtype`[i] %in% anti_disability){ data$Type[i] = &quot;Anti.Disability&quot; } } Here are first few rows of our modified data.

["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values All data are based on data provided by Law Enforcement in New York State. It’s already a summary integrating hate crimes happened in New York States from 2010 to 2018. In other words, the data here represent the numbers of hate crimes. If there is no hate crime of certain category, then the number will be 0. There is no null value in ’Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010.csv’: dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010.csv&quot;) any(is.na(dataset)) ## [1] FALSE There is no null value in ‘Hate_Crimes_data_Tidy.csv’: dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_data_Tidy.csv&quot;) any(is.na(dataset)) ## [1] FALSE Also, it makes sense that the Law Enforcement Department already performed an initial data cleaning by filtering out the missing values. Though there is no NA in datasets, we do found that two counties are not included in the original dataset, which are Wyoming county and Yates county. Given the fact that there are over 60 counties in New York state, we believe these two missing counties can be ignored. There may not be any missing pattern regarding these two counties, but there is still an interesting point that these two counties are both located in the west side of New York state and very close to each other.

["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 General Picture of Hate Crimes 5.2 Hate Crimes in Counties 5.3 Hate Crimes across Time", " Chapter 5 Results library(tidyverse) library(cowplot) library(ggplot2) library(ggpubr) library(forcats) library(maps) library(gridExtra) dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_data_Tidy.csv&quot;) plot_theme&lt;-theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(), panel.grid.major.x = element_line(), panel.background = element_blank(),, panel.grid.minor = element_line(), plot.background = element_rect(fill=&#39;#FAFAFA&#39;), axis.line = element_line(color=&#39;black&#39;), legend.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;#FAFAFA&#39;), legend.text=element_text(size=6.5)) These are the packages, data and the main theme that we are going to apply in the following exploratory data analysis. 5.1 General Picture of Hate Crimes How many hate crimes are taking place in NY state? Who are the people most affected? The stacked bar chart below provides us with a clear initial view. Hate crimes are categorized into 6 categories: Anti.Religion, Anti.Race, Anti.Sexual.Minority, Anti.Gender, Anti.Disability and Anti.Age. The methods of crime are further categorized into two types: crime against persons and property crimes. The stacked bar chart gives us an overview of the relative frequency of each category of hate crimes happened in NY states from 2010 to 2018. The most common type of hate crime is Anti.Religion, and more than half of this type were conducted against property.Then is the Anti.Race, Anti.Sexual.Minority, Anti.Gender and Anti.Disability. The least common type of hate crime is Anti.Age, and it is composed of almost crimes against property. It is notable that unlike Anti.Religion hate crimes and Anti.Age hate crimes, crimes against persons are more common among other types of hate crimes. Anti.Sexual.Minority hate crimes have a particularly high value for the proportion of crimes against persons. After having a general picture of frequencies of different types of hate crimes happened in NY state, we continue to dive in to look at frequencies of subcategories of each type of hate crimes. We also use stacked bar chart here to not only indicate the counts of subcategories of Anti.Gender but also demonstrate their divisions in crimes against person or property. Similar code was applied to other types of hate crimes. Eventually, we gained 6 stacked bar charts. What religions, races, gender.etc are most susceptible to hate crimes? We answer this question by investigating into each subtype of hate crimes. Within the Anti.Gender group, hate crimes against gender identity expression are of the most frequent.There’s a very small number of hate crimes against male. There are only less then 30 incidents of Anti.Age hate crimes during the 9 year period from 2010 to 2018, and about 83% are property crimes. Within the Anti.Race category, vast majority of the hate crimes are against African Americans. It is notable that Anti.White hate crimes are ranked 2nd most frequent. Within the Anti.Religion category, vast majority of the hate crimes are against Jewish, within which, vast majority are crimes against property, rather than against persons. The number of total incidents of Anti.Disability crimes is also very small, with only one incident against property. Anti.Gay.Male hate crimes are most common among the Anti.Sexual.Minority group, and the majority of these crimes are against persons. 5.2 Hate Crimes in Counties After investigating the overall distribution of all kinds of hate crimes, we now consider the distribution of different types of hate crimes in different counties. That is, we want to know if for some certain type of hate crimes, the total number of incicents corresponding to it vary in counties or not. Also, it is worth checking whether the distribution in counties changes among various kinds of hate crimes. Here total number of incidents of some type of hate crimes includes the whole time period from 2010 to 2018 and both crime types which are person and property. We draw heatmaps of total number of incidents in New York for different types of hate crimes. Now we have six plots of heatmaps where each heatmap corresponds to a certain type of hate crimes. First we can see that for Anti.Age, Anti.Gender and Anti.Disability, the maximum numbers of total incidents in each county are very small (less than 20), which means that these three types of hate crimes occur rarely in New York state. On the other hand, for Anti.Race, Anti.Religion, and Anti.Sexual.Minority, the maximum numbers of total incidents in each county are rather large (150, 800 and 200), which means these three types of hate crimes might occur more frequently in New York state compared to the other three types. Next we examine each type of hate crimes in detail. Regarding Anti.Age, almost every county has no incidents. There are only few counties with values around 3, and there are two counties which are located in the southeast corner of New York with values 6 and 12. (We can check in data that these counties are Queens and Suffolk) Regarding Anti.Gender, more counties have values greater than 0 compared to Anti.Age, which means that the Anti.Gender type might occur more frequently in New York. There is a county called Erie in the west side of New York and a county called Bronx in the southeast of New York with values around 8, and some counties in the middle of New York have values around 4, and the very small county New York in the southeast corner of New York state has a maximum value greater than 15, which should be noticed. (The names of counties can be checked in data, it is the same for the following analysis.) Regarding Anti.Race, almost every county has a value greater than 0. The county Erie in the west side of New York has the maximum value 150, and almost all counties in the southeast corner of New York have relatively large values. Regarding Anti.Religion, almost all large values appear in the southeast corner of New York and most of the other counties have values around 0. A county called Kings in the southeast corner of New York has the maximum value 800. We can notice that values in all other counties are far less than 800. Regarding Anti.Disability, the maximum value is just 3, which means this type occurs more rarely than Anti.Age and Anti.Gender. Almost every county has a value 0. Few counties in the west side of New York and some counties in the southeast of New york have values other than 0. Regarding Anti.Sexual.Minority, a few counties have values other than 0. We can see that New York county and Kings which are in the southeast side of New York have maximum values 250. And almost all other large values appear in the southeast corner. The county Erie also has a relatively large value. In conclusion, for a certain type of hate crimes, the total number of incicents corresponding to it vary in counties. Also, the distribution in counties changes among various kinds of hate crimes. We have to pay attention to two areas: one is the county Erie in the west side of New York and the other one is the southeast corner of New York, as these two areas have many large values for more than one type of hate crimes. We also annotate the location of New York city with text ‘NYC’ on six plots. We know that New York city is located in the southeast corner of New York state, a place we have to pay attention to. It’s notable that compared to other regions in New York state, New York city tends to have more incidents of all types of hate crimes. This is probably due to the significantly large and diverse population residing in the New York city than in other regions. For us, Columbia students, we should be careful with these possible dangerous situations and pay more attention to surroundings. There is a point that some counties in the heatmaps don’t have any value (or color). In the Missing Value chapter, we know these counties are Wyoming county and Yates county. 5.3 Hate Crimes across Time After examing the distributions of hate crimes in different counties, we know take time factor into consideration. In other words, we want to see if total incidents of each type of hate crimes vary cross time. And what’s more, we aim to integrate both county and time factors into the inspection of distribution of hate crimes in New York State. First, we looked at the time trend of two types of crimes in the NY state. In order to draw the line chart, we calculated the number of two crime types in different years, without considering the counties and hate crime types. In addition, we also found out an index, which equals to the counts at each year divided by the counts at first year. By doing so, we are able to analyze the relative changes cross years and their overall time trend. In the A plot, year versus the number of incidents of each crime type, it’s obvious to see that in 2010, the number of crime against persons is much higher than the number of crime against property. And as time goes on, the number of crime against persons starts to decrease and reaches its minimum in 2018, while the number of crime against property contains more flutuation. Number of crime against property reaches its maximum in 2012 and then begins to go down until 2015. In recent years, its number shows an increasing tendency. In the B plot, we can see the time trend of two crime types in a clearer way as two lines are seperated due to the use of index. Similar conclusion is drawn as A plot: number of crime against persons is decreasing while the number of crime against property is going up with some cyclical trends. What’s new in this plot is that we are able to see the relative changes compared with 2010, not in an aboslute means as we did in A plot. Next, let’s move on to exmaine on the time trend of hate crime types in NY state. Similar preprocessing procedure was done with the target data like the way we transformed in the crime type case. From the C plot, we can say that Anti.Religion is the most common hate crime type from 2010 to 2018. It reaches its maximum in 2012 and for other years, it remains approximately at the same level. Anti.Race is the second common type of hate crime in these years and it indicates an overall decreasing trend. Then, it’s the Anti.Sexual.Minority, which also demonstrates a general lowering tendency across years. In 2015 and 2016, its number comes to same level as the number of Anti.Race. For the rest of three type of hate crimes: Anti.Gender, Anti.Disability and Anti.Age, they stay at similar level from 2010 and 2018, roughly around 0 to 10. Anti.Gender reaches its highest point in 2016. Interestingly, D plot provides much more information about the time trend. Due to the small cases of certain type of hate crimes, some changes across years are hard to view in the C plot, while D plot ‘exaggerates’ those changes by using the relative change compared with numbers in 2010, especially the Anti.Age and Anti.Gender. From C plot, it’s difficult to view any fluctuations in Anti.Age and Anti.Gender across years. But, in D plot, we are able to view the obvious fluctuations in those two types. Specifically, for Anti.Age, it increases first, then goes down, then goes up to significanly high level, reaching its maximum in 2014, later drops a little and increases to the second highest point in 2016. And for Anti.Gender, it goes up for three years, decreases in next two years and then shows a significantly sharp increase from 2015 to 2016. Seeing the sharp increase in Anti.Age and Anti.Gender at a particular year, we are curious about which subtype of these two types causes such increase. As Anti.Age doesn’t have any subgroups, we focus on the subgroups of Anti.Gender. In order to see, we draw the time series line chart of years for subgroups of Anti.Gender. From the plot, we discover that the sharp increase in 2016 is largely caused by the sharp increase in Anti.Gender.Indentity.Expression in 2016. After investigating the time impact on the distribution of crimes types and hate crime types, we also want to incorporate county factor into the consideration. In particular,we want to see if location matters in the changes of numbers of incidents happened in these eight years. Same as before, we first did some transformation of data. Specifically, we find the total number of incidents of each county in 2010 and 2018 and then calculated the change percentage of each county. Because some counties don’t have any incidents in both 2010 and 2018, they show NaN in the final change_prop, which we considered as 0, indicating that their numbers of incidents stay at the same level. To visualize our result, we draw a county map, showing shift in proportion at each county. From the colored map, we noticed that all the counties show some degree of decrease in the total number of incidents. That’s why the scale of shift in proportion ranges from 0 to -1. Furthermore, we discovered that there are almost no great gaps in the filled color of each county, except the one locates around -75 longitude and 43 latitude. In other words, counties with large shift tend to connect with each other in at least one direction. Similar for counties with small shift.Such result seems plausible because people are moving between close counties. When one county starts to make some improvements on hate crimes, such as using education to decrease discrimination and increasing police force, its actions not only reduce the number of incidents in its area but also bring positive changes to its neighborhoods. Also, it’s easy to see that counties with relatively large shift locates at 43 latitude or at 74 longitude.Thus, from what we got, we may infer that location is associated with the shift of numbers of incidents from 2010 to 2018. Finally, we also annotated the location of NYC in the heatmap as we did in the question 2. We can see that from 2010 to 2018, the number of total incidents in NYC and its surrouding areas goes down significantly. As columbia students, we are glad to see such changes as it’s safer than before. We are thankful to everyone who works to relieve the hate, misconcept and discrimination in this city. And more importantly, we understand this problem requires all of us to actively engage. Although we cannot stop the hate crimes like what the police do, we are able to use our knowledge as the weapon to stop the spread of bias, thus helping to build a better society. "],
["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 New York State County-level Map", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 New York State County-level Map This map contains hate crimes data of counties in New York State. Once you mouse over the region, it will show its statistics of hate crimes on the side, helping you understand hate crime situation in different counties in a more straight way. With an interative map, audiences are able to know which region is which county, which is hard to achieve in the static heatmap as we conducted in the previous questions. In the static heatmap, if we label all the counties, the heatmap will become messy and difficult to view due to its relatively small size. An interactive map has the advantanges to show geological locations and their corresponding information and statistical data at the same time. Therefore, audiences can have better understanding of various types of hate crimes in different regions. The map data are provided on Wikimedia Commons. They were created using US Census Data in 2005 and Adobe Illustrator. You will probably notice that no data are showing up for NYC, Bronx and Long Island. That’s because some counties are created as “polygon” and some are “path”. Therefore, it’s hard to color them using D3 functions at the same time. We are still in the progress of learning D3, and we will make it in better view in the future. "],
["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We have successfully analyzed in this project the New York State hate crime data set. We now have a clear picture of how frequently each type of hate crime occurs in New York State, how hate crimes are distributed in each county and among all counties in the State, and the change in the number of total incidents between 2010 and 2018. Unfortunately, our data set does not include data on hate groups whose members may have committed or had direct involvement in some of these crimes. It would be productive to see the correlation between hate groups and hate crimes. For example, what type of hate crimes do particular hate groups commit most often? Do areas with high number of hate group activities also have a high number of hate crimes? Is there any correlation between the incidence of hate speech and that of hate crimes? These are all questions worth pursuing, as the answers to them can inform and sharpen our picture of hate crimes in New York State. It would also be interesting to analyze hate crimes across the entire United States. However, each state uses a different system for reporting hate crimes, and even has different criteria for defining hate crimes. For example, some states are more dedicated to the task of identifying hate crimes, whereas other states do not put as much effort into pursuing these cases because it is hard to cite tangible evidence of “hate” playing a role in the committing of a crime. According to CVI (the Crime Victims’ Institute), the Hate Crimes Task Force of New York demonstrates an effective means to overcome the lack of proper data collection with respect to hate crimes. We noticed during our analysis that certain groups of hate crime victims are more hesitant to report hate crimes due to a chronic distrust between their community and the police. For example, survey evidence shows that LGBTQ group often chooses not to report hate crimes, meaning that many cases of hate crimes perpetuated against individuals from this community are not prosecuted as hate crimes even if they are prosecuted. Although we believe the total number of hate crimes is underreported, we are not certain whether a particular type of hate crime is underreported to a greater extent than others. It will be interesting to look at a data set of hate crimes experienced by victims, rather than only the hate crimes that were prosecuted. "]
