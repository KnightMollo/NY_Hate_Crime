[["index.html", "Hate Crimes in the State of New York Chapter 1 Introduction", " Hate Crimes in the State of New York Haichao Yi, Heng Kan, Danyang Han, Zhuoyan Ma 2020-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction There are many international metropolises around the world, like London, Tokyo and Shanghai. Among those famous cities, New York is the most remarkable one. For example, it’s probably the only city where you can live with any languages other than English. However, there are still a number of people from different races, genders, religions etc. backgrounds still suffering from biases and discrimination. Hate Crime, or bias-motivated crime, is one of the most dangerous consequences. A hate crime is a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity.” In the simplest terms, a hate crime must include both “hate” and a “crime.” Hate crimes have server impact on our society in that damage is not limited to the immediate target of the crime, but to the entire group the victim represents. In light of recent tragedies such as the death of George Floyd, we want to know how much progress, if any, we’ve made in fighting against bias and discrimination. What populations, besides African Americans are susceptible to biases? In what region do hate crimes occur most frenquently? We resort to the New York Hate Crime data set to find answers. In order to have better understanding about hate crimes in New York City, we are looking for answers to these three questions: What’s the most frequent kind of hate crimes (i.e. against religion or race) in the State of New York and in its counties from 2010 to 2018? Which county in New York State has a relative large number of hate crimes? For each county, what’s the proportions of different kinds of hate crimes? If it’s different, can it suggest that county influences the distribution of hate crimes? What is the trend of hate crimes in numbers and types, in New York State from 2010 to 2018? We will also dive in to look at the trend in each county. The answers of these questions can give us very basic understanding of hate crimes in New York State, which can also serve as a good start for people who want to know more about hate crimes in New York State. The records of law enforcement only contain hate crimes investigated, and it’s highly possible the real data is way beyond this. Especially given the fact that systemic racism is still common in this country. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Provider 2.2 Problems with data source:", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Provider The data set is named as “Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type: Beginning 2010” and it is provided by New York Division of Criminal Justice Services. The Office of Justice Research and Performance is responsible for collecting data. Link to dataset: Hate Crimes by County and Bias Type: Beginning 2010 The definition of hate crime is as followed: Under New York State’s Hate Crime Law (Penal Law Article 485), a person commits a hate crime when one of a specified set of offenses is committed targeting a victim because of a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation, or when such an act is committed as a result of that type of perception or belief. These types of crimes can target an individual, a group of individuals, or public or private property. The dataset has 44 columns and 548 rows. The variable County and Crime Type are strings and all others are integers. Most of columns are names of hate crimes, including Anti-Male, Anti-female and so on. The problem with this dataset is many columns are purely names of hate crimes within the same category. For example, Anti-White, Anti-Black, Anti-American Indian/Alaskan Native, Anti-Asian and so on are all hate crimes against specific race. And there are many hate crimes against different religions. When handling this dataset, we will need to do some summary about kinds of hate crimes to have better understanding of this dataset. 2.2 Problems with data source: After doing research on hate crimes laws and how hate crimes are prosecuted, we believe our data set could underestimate the amount of actual hate crimes in NY. In order to prosecute, attorneys must prove the defendant’s intent was based on bias, which is notoriously difficult to prove. This added layer of complexity to otherwise straightforward cases of assaults or stealing shun attorneys from doing so, thus resulting in an overall under-reporting of hate crimes. What’s more, the data is based on law enforcement’s records, which means it’s hard to involve all possible prejudice-motivated illegal activities. The statistics doesn’t guarantee all hate crimes are documented. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation To get the tidy data, we first drop the last three columns namely Total.Incidents, Total.Victims, Total.Offenders, as we can still calculate them using the remaining data. Then we regard columns County, Year and Crime.Type as ID columns, which means we don’t make changes on them. We use the pivot_longer method to gather the rest of columns to create two columns Subtype and Count. Here Subtype means each small class of hate crimes such as Anti.Male, Anti.Female etc. Count is the corresponding number of cases for each small class. After that, we create a new column Type, containing six general classes that are Anti.Gender, Anti.Age, Anti.Race, Anti.Religion, Anti.Sexual.Minority and Anti.Disability. For each Subtype, it has a corresponding type. For example, the Subtype Anti.Female is related with the type Anti.Gender and the Subtype Anti.White is related with the type Anti.Race’. We use the for-loop to fill in the Type column for all rows. Here are first few rows of our modified data. ## County Year Crime.Type Subtype Count Type ## 1 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.Male 0 Anti.Gender ## 2 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.Female 0 Anti.Gender ## 3 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.Transgender 0 Anti.Gender ## 4 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.Gender.Identity.Expression 0 Anti.Gender ## 5 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.Age. 0 Anti.Age ## 6 Albany 2018 Crimes Against Persons Anti.White 1 Anti.Race "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values All data are based on data provided by Law Enforcement in New York State. It’s already a summary integrating hate crimes happened in New York States from 2010 to 2018. In other words, the data here represent the numbers of hate crimes. If there is no hate crime of certain category, then the number will be 0. Also, it makes sense that the Law Enforcement Department already performed an initial data cleaning by filtering out the missing values. There is no null value in ’Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010.csv’: dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_by_County_and_Bias_Type__Beginning_2010.csv&quot;) any(is.na(dataset)) ## [1] FALSE There is no null value in ‘Hate_Crimes_data_Tidy.csv’: dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hate_Crimes_data_Tidy.csv&quot;) any(is.na(dataset)) ## [1] FALSE Therefore, there is no missing value in both datasets. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 3", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 3 After examing the distributions of hate crimes in different counties, we know take time factor into consideration. In other words, we want to see if total incidents of each type of hate crimes vary cross time. And what’s more, we aim to integrate both county and time into the inspection of distribution of hate crimes in New York State. First, we looked at the time trend of two types of crimes in the NY state. In order to draw the line chart, we calculated the numbers of two crime types in different years, without considering the counties and hate crime types. In addition, we also found out an index, which equals to the counts at each year divided by the counts at first year. By doing so, we are able to analyze the relative changes cross years and their overall time trend. In the A plot, year versus the numbers of incidents of each crime type, it’s obvious to see that in 2010, the number of crime against persons is much higher than the number of crime against property. And as time goes on, the number of crime against persons starts to decrease and reaches its minimum in 2018, while the numbers of crime against property contains more flutuation. Number of crime against property reaches its maximum in 2012 and then begins to go down until 2015. In recent years, its number shows an increasing tendency. In the B plot, we can see the time trend of two crime types in a clearer way as two lines are seperated due to the use of index. Similar conclusion is drawn as A plot: numbers of crime against persons are decreasing while the numbers of crime against property are going up with some cyclical trends. What’s new in this plot is that we are able to see the relative changes compared with 2010, not in an aboslute means as we did in A plot. Next, let’s move on to exmaine on the time trend of hate crime types in NY state. Similar preprocessing procedure was done with the target data like the way we transformed in the crime type case. From the C plot, we can say that Anti-Religion is the most common hate crime type from 2010 to 2018. It reaches its maximum in 2012 and for other years, it remains approximately at the same level. Anti-Race is the second common type of hate crime in these years and it indicates an overall decreasing trend. Then, it’s the Anti-Sexual, which also demonstrates a general lowering tendency across years. In 2015 and 2016, its numbers come to same level as the numbers of Anti-Race. For the rest of three type of hate crimes: Anti-Gender, Anti-Disability and Anti-Age, they stay at similar level from 2010 and 2018, roughly around 0 to 10. Anti-Gender reaches its highest point in 2016. Interestingly, D plot provides much more information about the time trend. Due to the small cases of certain type of hate crimes, some changes across years are hard to view in the C plot, while D plot ‘exaggerates’ those changes by using the relative change compared with numbers in 2010, especially the Anti-Age and Anti-Gender. From C plot, it’s difficult to view any fluctuations in Anti-Age and Anti-Gender across years. But, in D plot, we are able to view the obvious fluctuations in those two types. Specifically, for Anti-Age, it increases first, then goes down, then goes up to significanly high level, reaching its maximum in 2014, later drops a little and increases to the second highest point in 2016. And for Anti-Gender, it goes up for three years, decreases in next two years and then shows a significantly sharp increase from 2015 to 2016. Seeing the sharp increase in Anti-Age and Anti-Gender at a particular year, we are curious about which sub-category of these two types causes such increase. As Anti-Age don’t have any sub-groups, we focus on the subgroups of Anti-Age. In order to see, we draw the time series line chart of years versus subgroups of Anti-Gender. From the plot, we discover that the sharp increase in 2016 is largely caused by the sharp increase in Anti-Gender-Indentity-Expression in 2016. After investing the time impact on the distribution of crimes types and hate crime types, we also want to incorporate county factor into the consideration. In particular,we want to see if location matters in the changes of numbers of incidents happened in these eight years. change_in_county&lt;-tidy %&gt;% filter(Year == c(2010,2018)) %&gt;% group_by(County,Year) %&gt;% summarise(Count=sum(Count)) %&gt;% mutate(change_prop = round((Count-Count[1])/Count[1], 2))%&gt;% filter(Year==2018) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% select(County,change_prop) change_in_county$change_prop[is.nan(change_in_county$change_prop)]&lt;-0 Same as before, we first did some transformation of data. Specifically, we find the total number of incidents of each county in 2010 and 2018 and then calculated the change percentage of each county. Because some counties don’t have any incidents in both 2010 and 2018, they show NaN in the final change_prop, which we considered them as 0, indicating that their number of incidents stay at the same level. To visualize our result, we draw a county map, showing shift in proportion at each county. From the colored map, we noticed that all the counties show some degree of decrease in the total number of incidents. That’s why the scale of shift in proportion ranges from 0 to -1. Furthermore, we discovered that there are almost no great gaps in the filled color of each county, except the one locates around -75 longitude and 43 latitude. This tells us that neighborhood effect influences the change in the number of total incidents. In other words, counties with large shift tend to connect with each other in at least one direction. Similar for counties with small shift. Also, it’s easy to see that counties with relatively large shift locates at 43 latitude or at 74 longitude.Thus, from what we got, we may infer that location does matter in the shift of numbers of incidents from 2010 to 2018.
